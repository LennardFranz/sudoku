# Sudoku Solver 
A basic sudoku solver, which can generate any possible solution for a given sudoku. The solver uses backtracking to generate all possible solutions.  
In addition to the backtracking algorithm i implemented another algorithm, which can only solve relativley easy puzzels the "beginner-human" way.

## Instructions 
In sudoku_solver.py two functions are defined, which represent the alogrithms for solving.   
Just call one of these functions to display all the possible solutions(backtracking) or one solution (human_solve)(only easy sudokus!!!).  
In sudoku_examples.py are some examples, which can be used in sudoku_solver.py
